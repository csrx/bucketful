* Instead of mixing textual output and logic, provide hooks for when certain events happen
* Properly extract the loopia-plugin
* Get a little closer to 100% test coverage
* Fix hardcoded dnsResolver (both in source and test)


Future stuff:
* Log total progress of uploads with respect to filesize (streaming?)
* Improve the logging messages in general
* Use colors in the text logging
