bucketful
=========




ToDo
====
* Work on 100% test coverage
* Figure out a way to test (most of) the bin-file
* For all combinations of input paramteters, test undefied-cases (for example, missing a region when creating a bucket)
* Log total progress of uploads with respect to filesize rather than number of started files (both would be best)
* Use colors in the text logging (to highlight the configed parts when printing)
